      "source": "## Using the Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS)\nIncreasingly, we expect computers to be able to use AI in order to understand spoken or typed commands in natural language. For example, we want to be able to say \"switch on the light\" or \"put the light on\", and have an AI-powered device understand the command and take appropriate action.\n\n### Provision the Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS)\nThe Microsoft cognitive services include the Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS), which enables you to define *intents* that are applied to *entities* based on *utterances*.\n\nTo get started with LUIS, follow these steps to provision the service in your Azure subscription:\n1. Open another browser tab and navigate to https://portal.azure.com.\n2. Sign in using your Microsoft account.\n3. Click **+ New**, and search for **Language Understanding**.\n4. In the list of services, click **Language Understanding**.\n5. In the **Language Understanding** blade, click **Create**.\n6. In the **Create** blade, enter the following details, and then click **Create**\n  * **Name**: A unique name for your service.\n  * **Subscription**: Your Azure subscription.\n  * **Location**: Choose a location in the US.\n  * **Pricing tier**: Choose the F0 pricing tier.\n  * **Resource Group**: Choose the existing resource group you used previously.\n7. Wait for the service to be created.\n\n### Create a LUIS App\nTo implement natural language understanding with LUIS, you must first create an app; and then add intents, utterances, and entities to define the commands you want the app to understand.\n1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to https://www.luis.ai/.\n2. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription. If this is the first time you have signed into LUIS, you may need to grant the app some permissions to access your account details, and then fill in some information and accept the terms of use.\n3. If a message prompting you to complete a tutorial in which you will create a *Scheduler* app is displayed, close it (you can complete this tutorial later - for now, we'll focus on a simpler example).\n4. Click **New App** and create a new app with the following settings:\n  * **Name**: Simple Home Automation\n  * **Culture**: English\n  * **Description**: A basic home automation example\n5. In the pane on the left, click **Intents**. Then click **Create new intent**, and add an intent with the name **Light On**.\n6. In the **Utterances** page for the **Light On** intent, type \"*switch the light on*\" and press **Enter** to add this utterance to the list.\n7. In the list of utterances, in the *switch the light on* utterance, hold the mouse over the word \"light\" so that the list shows the value *switch the [light] on*. Then click **[light]**,  type *Light*, and click **Create a new entity** and create a *simple* entity named **Light**.\n8. In the pane on the left, click **Intents** and click **Create new intent**, to add a second intent with the name **Light Off**.\n9. In the **Utterances** page for the **Light Off** intent, type \"*switch the light off*\" and press **Enter** to add this utterance to the list.\n10. In the list of utterances, in the *switch the light on* utterance, hold the mouse over the word \"light\" so that the list shows the value *switch the [light] on*. Then click **[light]** select the *Light* entity you created previously.\n11. At the top of the page, click **Train** to train the application\n12. After the app has been trained, click **Test**, and then in the test pane, enter the following utterances and verify that they are correctly interpreted as commands for the *Light On* and *Light Off* intents respectively:\n    * *turn on the light*\n    * *put the light off*\n13. At the top of the page, click **Publish**. Then ensure that the **Production** slot is selected and click **Publish**.\n14. After the app has been published, note the **Endpoint** URL that is generated for your app at the bottom of the page - this includes the location where you provisioned the service, your app ID, and the key assigned to the app.\n\n### Consume the LUIS App\nNow that you have published your LUIS app, you can consume it from a client application by making HTTP requests that include a query string. The query will be used to identify the most likely intent, which will be returned to the calling client as in JSON response.\n\nModify the **endpointUrl** variable declaration in the cell below to reflect the endpoint URL for your app. Then run the cell, and enter a command when prompted to call your service and interpret the command. The JSON response is shown with an appropriate image for each command.\n\nTry the following commands:\n* *Switch on the light*\n* *Turn on the light*\n* *Turn off the light*\n* *Could you put the light on please?*",
